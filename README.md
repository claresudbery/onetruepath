# onetruepath

From the Hack Manchester in 2015 where I competed with Laurent from LateRooms.

This was based on the adventure game format, where you get a different path trhrough depending on what answers you give to various questions.

I confess at the time of writing I forget how this was supposed to work, but if you look at [this json file](https://github.com/claresudbery/onetruepath/blob/master/src/OneTruePath.API/test-import.json), I think it gives some idea about how the questions / answers might have been structured.
